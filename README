Disclaimer:
This port of DXX-Rebirth to Android was done back in 2011, and haven't been tested since. It may or may not work on more modern versions of Android.
The phone used for testing was the Sony Xperia Play, so that's how the keymapping was done.

The RCS history is truncated, and I can't remember what version of Rebirth it was based on, so I don't know how usable this will be for anyone.

How to build for Android (assuming SDK and NDK is installed in ~/android):
cd arch/android/
~/android/android-ndk-r6b/ndk-build -C . NDK_PROJECT_PATH=.
~/android/android-sdk-linux/tools/android update project --path `pwd` --target android-10

How to install it:
ant debug install
